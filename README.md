# 🚢 Titanic EDA Project – Survival Analysis

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The aim is to uncover key patterns that influenced passenger survival during the disaster using data visualization and exploratory analysis.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Univariate & bivariate visualizations (bar plots, boxplots, heatmaps)
- Insights on Age, Class, Gender, and Fare vs. survival
- Summary of findings

## 📊 Observations

- **Younger passengers** had a slightly higher survival rate
- **Females** had a much higher chance of survival than males
- **First-class passengers** survived more frequently
- **Fare** positively correlated with survival

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PDF export for final reporting
